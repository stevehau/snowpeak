"Dear Adventurer,

If you are reading this, you have proven yourself worthy. You helped others along the way, you followed the clues, and you braved the mountain's secrets.

I built Snowpeak Resort as a place where beginners could find magic in the mountains. The Golden Ski Trophy was never about gold -- it was about the journey. The friends you made. The puzzles you solved. The courage to explore the unknown.

Keep the trophy as a reminder: every expert was once a beginner, and every mountain is climbed one step at a time.

With warm regards and fresh powder,
Tobias Snowpeak
Founder, Snowpeak Resort
1978"

Congratulations! You have completed THE SECRET OF SNOWPEAK RESORT!`,
